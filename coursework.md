To understand what the term means, it is helpful to first define the single concepts.

### Definition of Culture

"CULTURE IS HOW ORGANIZATIONS DO THINGS." - [Robbie Katanga](https://hbr.org/2013/05/what-is-organizational-culture)

Culture describes the overarching system of values and norms adopted by a group of people. It refers to the behavioral patterns in an organization that can be observed. Consequently, these behavior occur repeatedly.

### Definition of Organization

"A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WORK TOGETHER IN AN ORGANIZED WAY FOR A SHARED PURPOSE." - [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/organization)

An organization is a collaborative system existing for a specific period of time. With the help of personal or material task bearers e.g. people or machineries, tasks are carried out on behalf of the organization in fulfillment of the organization's goals.


### What is the definition of Organizational Culture?

Organizational culture is defined as a system of shared values and norms among members that differentiates the organization from other organizations. In the ideal case, the organizational culture is accepted and shared by every member of the organization. It is a result of interactions and usually reveals itself in common practices. An example for this can be, that every meeting within a company ends with collecting results and planing the next steps. Consequently, the organizational culture is based on unwritten rules of a social system, being expressed in all processes of the organization. The organizational culture makes the company unique; there is no other organization with the exact same culture. Since is it is subject to the interpretations of the individual, it is constantly changing.

## How is to learn the organizational culture in the workplace?

The four ways culture is transmitted to employees:

*__Stories__*: Telling stories about significant events or people, such as a CEO speech or reactions to mistakes made, provides employees with information about what values and behaviors are desired in the organization. At the same time, it provides explanation for certain practices and illustrates what is of great relevance to the company. 

*__Rituals__*: Corporate rituals and ceremonies that highlight the achievements of an individual or a team, for example, make it clear who is of particularly high relevance to the company. Another example would be that every employee is given a little present for his or her birthday. This form of appreciation reflects the culture of the organization. 

*__Symbols__*: The use of material symbols gives employees within an organization information about how the hierarchical structure prevails in the company and what behaviors are expected. If the CEO sits in the same office as the other employees, it indicates an organization with flat structures. However, if the CEO has his office several floors higher than his employees, there are strict hierarchies in the company. 

*__Language__*: The use of language also allows conclusions to be drawn about organizational culture. If an employee is familiar with the common abbreviations or terms used daily in the company, he or she is familiar with the culture of the organization.
