To understand what the term means, it is helpful to first define the single concepts.

### Definition of Culture

"CULTURE IS HOW ORGANIZATIONS DO THINGS." - [Robbie Katanga](https://hbr.org/2013/05/what-is-organizational-culture)

Culture describes the overarching system of values and norms adopted by a group of people. It refers to the behavioral patterns in an organization that can be observed. Consequently, these behavior occur repeatedly.

### Definition of Organization

"A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WORK TOGETHER IN AN ORGANIZED WAY FOR A SHARED PURPOSE." - [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/organization)

An organization is a collaborative system existing for a specific period of time. With the help of personal or material task bearers e.g. people or machineries, tasks are carried out on behalf of the organization in fulfillment of the organization's goals.


### What is the definition of Organizational Culture?

Organizational culture is defined as a system of shared values and norms among members that differentiates the organization from other organizations. In the ideal case, the organizational culture is accepted and shared by every member of the organization. It is a result of interactions and usually reveals itself in common practices. An example for this can be, that every meeting within a company ends with collecting results and planing the next steps. Consequently, the organizational culture is based on unwritten rules of a social system, being expressed in all processes of the organization. The organizational culture makes the company unique; there is no other organization with the exact same culture. Since is it is subject to the interpretations of the individual, it is constantly changing.
